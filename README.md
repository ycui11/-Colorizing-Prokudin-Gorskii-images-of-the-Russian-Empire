# -Colorizing-Prokudin-Gorskii-images-of-the-Russian-Empiren

Background


Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944) was a photographer who, between the years 1909-1915, traveled the Russian empire and took thousands of photos of everything he saw. He used an early color technology that involved recording three exposures of every scene onto a glass plate using a red, green, and blue filter. Back then, there was no way to print such photos, and they had to be displayed using a special projector. Prokudin-Gorskii left Russia in 1918. His glass plate negatives survived and were purchased by the Library of Congress in 1948. Today, a digitized version of the Prokudin-Gorskii collection is available online.

Overview



The goal of this assignment is to learn to work with images by taking the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and automatically producing a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, you will need to extract the three color channel images, place them on top of each other, and align them so that they form a single RGB color image.
